- 👋 Hi, I’m @SodaCracker
- 👀 I’m interested in game developing, game designing, and game playing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Graphics and other things related to audio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that the graphics and the audio are cool, and the truth of the story become more and more confusing, but more interesting.
